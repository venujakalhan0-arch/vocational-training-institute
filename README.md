# vocational-training-institute
The web-based platform SkillPro was created to assist a vocational training facility that provides a range of hands-on courses, including ICT, plumbing, welding, and hotel management. This web application's primary goal is to digitize the institute's operations by enabling online communication between administrators, teachers, and students.
